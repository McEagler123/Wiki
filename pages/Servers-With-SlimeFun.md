# Servers

There Are multiple Servers, on both Eaglercraft and Java Minecraft, that Have SlimeFun. 
This is a list I have put together, from my experience and from research.
SlimeFun is kind of inconsistent, in that it is frequently removed and added to servers, so this list may not be 100% accurate.

### 1. DataDecay
**Ip: I'll update later**

A really fun server, that I am working on developing, has SlimeFun 4, multiple gamemodes, and is really fun.
Check Out my friend/Genius coder on his account, DataDecay.

**SlimeFun Addons**

Has None yet, just plain Slimefun, But We're Working on it.

### 2. Time Legacy

**Ip: Mc.time-legacy.net (if unavailable use Ep.nitrogendioxide.dev)**

An awesome server, With Survival, Skyblock, Oneblock, Arena Coming soon, and a Fifth Gamemode Being teased.
They have lots of Cool addons, and A really awesome playing enviroment. Currently has Slimefun Removed, but Its coming back!

(Warning: Skyblock especially, but Sometimes Gamemodes go offline for a few days.)

**SlimeFun Addons**

Last I checked, This server had ExoticGarden, PocketPets, Slimetinker, LiteXpansion, And More!

### 3. Titan Network
